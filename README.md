# axios-upload-to-google-cloud

Google cloud storage has fantastic prices compared to persistent disk and the like.  Unfortunately there don't seem to be many tutorials out there to help a new user figure out how to interact with google cloud storage.  My goal was to have my server provide download and upload links to files that were uploaded to google cloud storage.  This project is the first step in that process, a HTML form (using javascript with axios) to upload files using a signed url generated with gsutil.  I will update with and clean up the code as I go along.
